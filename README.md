This node is for SDXL and will allow for prompting SDXL blocks directly for better control and heavily reducing nightmare outputs.

I recommend using Nvidia Align your steps scheduler attached to a samplercustomadvanced in comfyui, connect the guider. Use conditioningzeroout on positive and negative.

PS. I am working on a node that will do all of this and more, inject SD3 weights and bias layers (to fix woman in grass) called Magic Model Injector
